## The History: Luziamar (1974-1995)

### A Cultural Phenomenon

[Luziamar opened in 1974](https://noticiasdeviana.pt/de-meca-da-musica-a-lugar-abandonado-o-luziamar-faria-50-anos), just 12 days before Portugal's Carnation Revolution. For over two decades, it became legendary:

- **"The mecca of music"** — considered the best discotheque in Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula
- **Complete resort complex**: Discotheque, restaurant, bar, swimming pool, tennis courts, mini-golf
- **Revolutionary for its time**: 360° panoramic views, special effects (confetti, soap bubbles, slides)
- **Cultural icon**: Ranked alongside Romaria festival and Santa Luzia basilica as symbols of Viana do Castelo
- **Social hub**: "Where people found spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends" — a place that created lifelong connections

### The Closure Mystery

Around 1995, Luziamar closed. The reasons remain unclear — it wasn't lack of customers; the place was thriving. Since then:

- **2005**: [Fire consumed part of the complex](https://www.publico.pt/2005/10/14/local/noticia/viana-do-castelo-incendio-consome-parte-do-complexo-turistico-do-luziamar-1235657)
- **2005**: Owners announced €10 million restoration plan — never executed
- **2018-2020**: Academic thesis projects and design competitions — owners still seeking solutions
- **2025**: Building stands in ruins, but the memory lives on

**The building has been waiting for the right partners.**

### Today: The Ruins

The pool area tells the story of three decades of abandonment:

Inside, the famous 360° view octagon still stands:

### The Memory Lives On

People still throw **["Remember Luziamar"](https://noticiasdeviana.pt/de-meca-da-musica-a-lugar-abandonado-o-luziamar-faria-50-anos/)** parties in Viana do Castelo, celebrating the spirit of a place that closed three decades ago. There's even a traditional dish named after it: "Bacalhau à Luziamar."

This isn't just a building — it's a living memory in the collective consciousness of the region.
