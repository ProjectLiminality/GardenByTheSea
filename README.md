# Garden by the Sea

> *"Portugal is a garden by the sea."* — Fernando Pessoa

Turning the abandoned Luziamar complex next to Praia do Cabedelo in Viana do Castelo into the most magical cultural nexus point on the planet.

## Vibe Anchor

*The frequency of the dream: Hotel Adriano from Porco Rosso. A garden by the sea where life is celebrated — families during the day, magic at night, always open, always welcoming.*

---

## The Location

**Praia do Cabedelo, Viana do Castelo, Portugal**

- One of the best kitesurfing beaches in Europe
- First line of the beach, near the mouth of the Lima River
- Surf school adjacent to the property
- Permanent camping site nearby
- Viana do Castelo itself carries a remarkably similar vibe to Porco Rosso's Adriatic setting

### The Property

- **Size**: ~20,000 m² of beachfront land
- **Status**: Abandoned since ~1995, actively listed for sale
- **Current Owner**: Construções Rites, Lda (Agostinho Rites, majority shareholder)
- **Permits**: Approved building permit for ~80 tourist apartments + facilities
- **Contact**: +351 258 828 798 | Praça da República, nº30, Viana do Castelo

### Building Architecture

The original 1969 design (by an architect yet to be fully identified) created a distinctive structure:
- **Three interconnected volumes**: Two parallelepipeds and a central octagon
- **Two main floors** plus a third-floor solarium on the eastern volume
- **360° panoramic views** from the main entertainment spaces

## The History: Luziamar (1974-1995)

### A Cultural Phenomenon

Luziamar opened in 1974, just 12 days before Portugal's Carnation Revolution. For over two decades, it became legendary:

- **"The mecca of music"** — considered the best discotheque in Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula
- **Complete resort complex**: Discotheque, restaurant, bar, swimming pool, tennis courts, mini-golf
- **Revolutionary for its time**: 360° panoramic views, special effects (confetti, soap bubbles, slides)
- **Cultural icon**: Ranked alongside Romaria festival and Santa Luzia basilica as symbols of Viana do Castelo
- **Social hub**: "Where people found spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends" — a place that created lifelong connections
- **Regional reach**: Drew visitors from across northern Portugal and Galicia (Spain)

### The Original Vision (1969)

The original plans were even grander than what was built:
- Swimming pool, restaurant, party hall, tennis court, playground
- **A hotel was planned for Phase 2** — but never materialized
- Initially designed as an upper-middle-class club, not "just" a disco

### The Closure Mystery

Around 1995, Luziamar closed. The reasons remain somewhat unclear — it wasn't lack of customers; the place was thriving. Since then:

- **2005**: Fire consumed part of the complex
- **2005**: Owners announced €10 million restoration plan (hotel, bars, residential) — never executed
- **2018-2020**: Academic thesis projects and design competitions — owners still seeking solutions
- **2025**: Building stands in ruins, but the memory lives on

### Why 30 Years of Waiting?

Piecing together the evidence:
- Phase 2 (the hotel) never happened — ambitions exceeded execution from the start
- The 2005 fire damaged part of the complex
- The €10M restoration plan likely couldn't secure financing
- A separate company **"Luziamar, Sociedade Promotora do Turismo Vianense S.A"** (€500K capital) still exists specifically for this property
- The owners have launched design competitions and commissioned thesis projects — they haven't given up, but can't execute alone

**The building has been waiting for the right partners.**

### The Memory Lives On

People still throw **"Remember Luziamar"** parties in Viana do Castelo, celebrating the spirit of a place that closed three decades ago. There's even a traditional dish named after it: "Bacalhau à Luziamar."

This isn't just a building — it's a living memory in the collective consciousness of the region.

## The Vision

### Daytime: The Garden

A welcoming space open to all:
- Families enjoying the beach
- Restaurant with ocean views
- Swimming pool area
- Surf culture integration
- A place to simply *be*

### Nighttime: Ataraxia Gatherings

A new form of conscious celebration — channeling the immense psychic energy of rave culture into something coherent and intentional:

**The Journey Structure:**
1. **First Movement (Masculine/Shambhala Warrior)**: Perceiving samsara — seeing clearly through the darkness without distortion, without being deceived
2. **Second Movement (Feminine/Peace)**: Expressing nirvana — dreamy, psychedelic, garden-like peace

**Core Elements:**
- Sacraments taken together intentionally
- Dynamic group prayer on the dance floor
- Developing protocols to transform hedonistic heat into a "mighty instrument of peace"
- Calling upon "the most high, the absolute authority to demand what is ours — world peace and the kingdom of heaven for every child of God"

### CE5 Contact

The beach provides the perfect setting for Steven Greer's CE5 protocols — group meditation for world peace under the stars, open to contact.

### The Larger Container

Adjacent land (reportedly available) could enable:
- A more permanent village/community component
- The building as event space
- Integration with "The Garden" — an existing community space near Viana do Castelo with natural cultural resonance

## The Garden Connection

**[The Garden](https://thegarden.pt)** is an existing intentional community ~45 minutes from Porto, 20 minutes from beaches, near Viana do Castelo.

### What They Are
- "A living research institute" exploring new forms of cohabitation, coordination, creation, and connection
- Non-profit association, explicitly "not a spiritual community"
- "A strange attractor... an earnest attempt to build a world more compelling than the screen you're looking at now"

### Their Vibe
They cultivate "a network & creative cauldron for embodied genius, art, world builders/hackers, nerds, black sheep, (nature) lovers, & cultural activists" who "swim in the edges of possibility, where the path from imagination to reality is short & sweet."

### Activities
Collaborative art, dance, music jams, yoga, meditation, foraging, beach trips, raves, book clubs, contact improv, circus arts, social experiments, and more.

### Current Status
- **Closed until Spring 2026** for development
- Contact: living@thegarden.pt
- Returning residents don't need to reapply

### The Resonance
The Garden's ethos aligns remarkably with the Garden by the Sea vision. Natural collaboration potential exists.

## Why This Matters

### The Omya Connection

Omya and similar communities are building transformational spaces around the world — but nothing yet in Europe. This could be the landing point.

**What they bring:**
- Community of spiritual, successful, impactful people
- Experience building healing spaces
- Resources to manifest large visions

**What this location offers:**
- Unparalleled beachfront setting
- Deep cultural memory and local love
- European gateway
- Existing building permit and willing seller

### The Miracle Consciousness Approach

This vision doesn't require force. Like GameStop, like WallStreetBets, like anything that truly matters — it spreads through resonance.

The building has been waiting for 30 years. The owners have been trying to do something with it for 30 years. The community still throws parties in its memory. The permits are in place. The property is listed.

Perhaps it's been waiting for this exact constellation of elements to align.

## Academic Research

Two master's theses have been written specifically about rehabilitating Luziamar:

### "(Re)Habitar Luziamar" (2018)
- **Author**: Liliana Cristina Rodrigues Branco
- **University**: University of Beira Interior
- **Proposal**: Rehabilitation + expansion, recovering tourism function with residential components
- **Access**: [uBibliorum Repository](https://ubibliorum.ubi.pt/handle/10400.6/8469)

### "Do processo à obra, da ruína ao projecto" (2020)
- **Author**: Magda Letícia Farinha Afonso
- **University**: University of Porto
- **Proposal**: Hotel-Aparthotel conversion using space-time architectural concept
- **Note**: This was in response to a **design competition launched by the property owner**

Both theses confirm: **Rehabilitation is architecturally viable.** The building's distinctive structure (three volumes, central octagon, panoramic views) can be preserved while creating modern hospitality spaces.

## Open Questions

### Immediate Research Needed

1. **Property Price**: Not listed publicly — requires direct inquiry to Construções Rites
2. **Specific Adjacent Plots**: Which of the 79+ available plots are closest to Luziamar?
3. **Permit Flexibility**: Can the approved permits be modified for different use cases (community space vs. pure hotel)?

### Vision Refinement

1. **Omya Engagement**: What would a compelling pitch deck look like for their European expansion?
2. **The Garden Collaboration**: How might Garden by the Sea and The Garden community work together?
3. **Local Integration**: Who are the key stakeholders who remember Luziamar and might champion its rebirth?
4. **Governance Model**: What structure would allow this to be truly community-owned rather than another private development?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Contact Construções Rites** directly to inquire about:
   - Asking price
