*The frequency of the dream: Hotel Adriano from Porco Rosso. A garden by the sea where life is celebrated — families during the day, magic at night, always open, always welcoming.*

## The History: Luziamar (1974-1995)

### A Cultural Phenomenon

Luziamar opened in 1974, just 12 days before Portugal's Carnation Revolution. For over two decades, it became legendary:

- **"The mecca of music"** — considered the best discotheque in Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula
- **Complete resort complex**: Discotheque, restaurant, bar, swimming pool, tennis courts, mini-golf
- **Revolutionary for its time**: 360° panoramic views, special effects (confetti, soap bubbles, slides)
- **Cultural icon**: Ranked alongside Romaria festival and Santa Luzia basilica as symbols of Viana do Castelo
- **Social hub**: "Where people found spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends" — a place that created lifelong connections

### The Closure Mystery

Around 1995, Luziamar closed. The reasons remain unclear — it wasn't lack of customers; the place was thriving. Since then:

- **2005**: Fire consumed part of the complex
- **2005**: Owners announced €10 million restoration plan — never executed
- **2018-2020**: Academic thesis projects and design competitions — owners still seeking solutions
- **2025**: Building stands in ruins, but the memory lives on

**The building has been waiting for the right partners.**

### The Memory Lives On

People still throw **"Remember Luziamar"** parties in Viana do Castelo, celebrating the spirit of a place that closed three decades ago. There's even a traditional dish named after it: "Bacalhau à Luziamar."

This isn't just a building — it's a living memory in the collective consciousness of the region.

## The Vision

### Daytime: The Garden

A welcoming space open to all:
- Families enjoying the beach
- Restaurant with ocean views
- Swimming pool area
- Surf culture integration
- A place to simply *be*

### Nighttime: Ataraxia Gatherings

A new form of conscious celebration — channeling the immense psychic energy of rave culture into something coherent and intentional:

**The Journey Structure:**
1. **First Movement (Masculine/Shambhala Warrior)**: Perceiving samsara — seeing clearly through the darkness without distortion, without being deceived
2. **Second Movement (Feminine/Peace)**: Expressing nirvana — dreamy, psychedelic, garden-like peace

**Core Elements:**
- Sacraments taken together intentionally
- Dynamic group prayer on the dance floor
- Developing protocols to transform hedonistic heat into a "mighty instrument of peace"
- Calling upon "the most high, the absolute authority to demand what is ours — world peace and the kingdom of heaven for every child of God"

### CE5 Contact

The beach provides the perfect setting for Steven Greer's CE5 protocols — group meditation for world peace under the stars, open to contact.

### The Larger Container

Adjacent land could enable:
- A more permanent village/community component
- The building as event space
- Integration with "The Garden" — an existing intentional community near Viana do Castelo

---

## The Garden Connection

**[The Garden](https://thegarden.pt)** is an existing intentional community near Viana do Castelo.

- "A living research institute" exploring new forms of cohabitation, coordination, creation, and connection
- Non-profit association cultivating "a network & creative cauldron for embodied genius, art, world builders/hackers, nerds, black sheep, (nature) lovers, & cultural activists"
- Activities: collaborative art, dance, music jams, yoga, meditation, foraging, raves, social experiments
- Currently closed until Spring 2026 for development
- Contact: living@thegarden.pt

The Garden's ethos aligns remarkably with the Garden by the Sea vision. Natural collaboration potential exists.

## Why This Matters

### The Omya Connection

Omya and similar communities are building transformational spaces around the world — but nothing yet in Europe. This could be the landing point.

**What they bring:**
- Community of spiritual, successful, impactful people
- Experience building healing spaces
- Resources to manifest large visions

**What this location offers:**
- Unparalleled beachfront setting
- Deep cultural memory and local love
- European gateway
- Existing building permit and willing seller

### The Miracle Consciousness Approach

This vision doesn't require force. Like anything that truly matters — it spreads through resonance.

The building has been waiting for 30 years. The owners have been trying to do something with it for 30 years. The community still throws parties in its memory. The permits are in place. The property is listed.

Perhaps it's been waiting for this exact constellation of elements to align.

## Event Capacity

For large gatherings, adjacent accommodation already exists:

- **INATEL Cabedelo Camping**: 25 hectares, 300 tent + 156 caravan pitches, direct beach access
- **FeelViana Sport Hotel**: 46 rooms + 9 bungalows, directly at Praia do Cabedelo
- **Viana do Castelo**: 192 hotels within range, 1.5-2.5km away

**Total nearby capacity**: 500+ camping spots + 100+ hotel rooms

## Academic Research

Two master's theses confirm **rehabilitation is architecturally viable**:

- **"(Re)Habitar Luziamar" (2018)** — Liliana Branco, University of Beira Interior
- **"Do processo à obra, da ruína ao projecto" (2020)** — Magda Afonso, University of Porto (in response to a design competition launched by the property owner)

Both propose preserving the distinctive three-volume structure while creating modern hospitality spaces.

## Open Questions

1. **Property Price**: Not listed publicly — requires direct inquiry to Construções Rites
2. **Permit Flexibility**: Can approved permits be modified for community space vs. pure hotel?
3. **Adjacent Land**: What parcels are available closest to Luziamar?
4. **Governance Model**: What structure would allow this to be truly community-owned?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Contact Construções Rites** — asking price, permit details, adjacent land
2. **Connect with The Garden** — collaboration potential (living@thegarden.pt)
3. **Create pitch materials** for Omya and potential partners
4. **Connect with local community** — people who remember Luziamar
